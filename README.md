üèè Cricket Shot Analyzer
The Cricket Shot Analyzer is a modular Python application that performs real-time biomechanical analysis of a cricket cover drive from a video. It uses MediaPipe for pose estimation, calculates key biomechanical metrics, and provides a detailed evaluation of the shot.

The script processes a local video, generates an annotated video with live metric overlays, and produces a comprehensive report in HTML format.

üöÄ Quick Start Guide
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip package manager

2. Installation Steps
Create a project directory:

mkdir cricket-analyzer
cd cricket-analyzer

Save the files:

Save the provided Python code as cricket_analyzer.py.

Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies:

opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
matplotlib

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv cricket_env
# On macOS/Linux:
source cricket_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\cricket_env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a default configuration file:
The application automatically creates a config.ini file on the first run, but you can create an empty one manually.

touch config.ini

Place your video file:
Place the video file you wish to analyze in the project root directory. By default, the script looks for input_video.mp4, as specified in the config.ini file.

3. Running the Analysis
python cricket_analyzer.py

The script will process the video, and you can monitor the progress and FPS directly in your terminal. A real-time video window will also be displayed with the analysis overlays.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options
The application's behavior is controlled by the config.ini file. This file is automatically generated with default values if it doesn't exist.

[PATHES]
input_video: The path to your input video file.

output_video: The path to save the annotated output video.

output_json: The path to save the raw JSON evaluation data.

output_plot: The path to save the temporal metrics plot (.png format).

output_report: The path to save the final HTML report.

[THRESHOLDS]
min_detection_confidence: Minimum confidence for pose detection (0.1-1.0).

min_tracking_confidence: Minimum confidence for pose tracking (0.1-1.0).

visibility_threshold: Minimum visibility score for a landmark to be considered.

max_missed_frames: Number of frames to continue tracking a batsman after a lost detection.

fps_target: Target FPS for real-time performance.

elbow_angle_min / elbow_angle_max: The acceptable range for the front elbow angle.

spine_lean_max: The maximum allowable spine lean angle in degrees.

head_knee_max: The maximum acceptable normalized distance for head-knee alignment.

foot_angle_min / foot_angle_max: The acceptable range for front foot direction.

contact_velocity_threshold: Velocity threshold for detecting bat-ball contact.

phase_velocity_threshold: Velocity threshold for triggering phase transitions.

[REFERENCE]
elbow_angle_ideal: The ideal target value for the elbow angle.

spine_lean_ideal: The ideal target value for spine lean.

head_knee_ideal: The ideal target value for head-knee distance.

foot_angle_ideal: The ideal target value for foot direction.

üìä Outputs
After the script finishes, the following files will be generated in the output/ directory:

annotated_video.mp4: The original video with the pose skeleton and real-time metric overlays.

evaluation.json: A JSON file containing the raw scores, feedback, and temporal data.

temporal_metrics.png: A chart visualizing the key metric trends over time.

report.html: A comprehensive HTML report summarizing all the findings, including scores, feedback, and the generated plot.

üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Error processing video": Ensure the video file path in your config.ini is correct and that the file exists.

"Module not found" error: Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Slow analysis or low FPS:

Use shorter video clips or reduce the video resolution.

Adjust the model_complexity in cricket_analyzer.py to a lower value (e.g., 1 or 0).

Pose detection fails:

Ensure the video has good lighting and a clear view of the person.

Try adjusting the detection confidence parameters in config.ini.

Permissions error: If you encounter an error related to permissions, try running the script with administrator privileges.

üßê Understanding Results
Scoring System
10/10: Professional-level technique.

8-9/10: Advanced amateur level.

6-7/10: Intermediate level with room for improvement.

4-5/10: Beginner level, needs significant work.

1-3/10: Major technical issues.

Key Metrics
Elbow Angle: Position of the front elbow during the swing.

Head Position: Alignment of the head with the front knee.

Spine Lean: Evaluation of body posture and balance.

Foot Direction: Front foot positioning relative to the crease.

Follow-through: Completion of the swing motion.

Phase Analysis
Stance: Initial ready position.

Stride: Forward movement in preparation.

Downswing: Bat movement toward the ball.

Impact: The moment of contact.

Follow-through: Post-contact swing completion.

Recovery: Return to the ready position.
